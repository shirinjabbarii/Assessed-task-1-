Life
and
career
Early
life
Abel
Makkonen
Tesfaye
was
born
on
February
16
,
1990
,
in
Toronto
,
Ontario
,
Canada
.
The
only
child
of
Ethiopian
Amhara
immigrants
Makkonen
Tesfaye
and
Samrawit
Hailu
,
who
separated
shortly
after
his
birth
,
he
was
raised
in
the
suburb
of
Scarborough
by
his
mother
and
grandmother
.
Tesfaye
's
patronymic
is
spelled
"
Makkonen
"
instead
of
the
traditional
Ethiopian
name
"
Makonnen
"
.
The
similarity
with
the
Finnish
surname
Makkonen
is
pure
coincidence
.
The
spelling
of
Tesfaye
's
patronymic
might
be
the
result
of
a
typographic
error
or
a
new
form
of
the
traditional
name
.
Tesfaye
is
proficient
in
Amharic
,
his
native
language
acquired
from
his
grandmother
,
and
is
also
fluent
in
French
,
as
he
attended
a
French
immersion
school
.
He
was
further
educated
at
West
Hill
Collegiate
Institute
and
Birchmount
Park
Collegiate
Institute
.
At
seventeen
,
Tesfaye
dropped
out
of
school
and
relocated
to
an
apartment
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Parkdale
with
two
friends
,
one
of
whom
is
La
Mar
Taylor
—
his
best
friend
and
now
creative
director
.
Living
a
hedonistic
lifestyle
with
his
friends
,
Tesfaye
adopted
his
stage
name
due
to
the
time
he
left
being
on
a
weekend
.
He
removed
the
last
'
e
'
in
'
weekend
'
to
avoid
trademark
issues
with
the
Canadian
pop
rock
band
the
Weekend
.
He
has
also
experienced
homelessness
and
was
incarcerated
on
several
occasions
during
this
time
,
which
encouraged
him
to
"
smarten
up
,
to
focus
"
.
During
this
time
,
Tesfaye
frequently
engaged
in
drug
use
,
including
substances
such
as
ketamine
,
cocaine
,
MDMA
,
magic
mushrooms
,
and
cough
syrup
,
stating
that
drugs
were
a
"
crutch
"
for
him
when
he
wrote
music
.
Before
releasing
music
under
his
current
stage
name
,
he
went
under
the
alias
'
Kin
Kane
'
,
as
part
of
a
hip
-
hop
duo
called
'
Bulleez
n
Nerdz

the
Weeknd
"
in
favor
of
performing
under
his
birth
name
,
or
adopting
a
new
pseudonym
altogether
.
He
explained
that
his

The

co-created
the
HBO
drama
series
The
Idol
with

series
premiered

Film
Festival
out
of
competition
,
where
it
received
significant
controversy
for
its
graphic
depiction
of
onscreen
nudity
and
sexual
content
.
The
series
debuted
to
widespread
negative
reviews
from
critics
.
The
Hollywood
Reporter
stated
that
the
series
confirms
the
allegations
that
"
Instead
of
subtly
skewering
the
misogynistic
and
predatory
nature
of
the
business
,
The
Idol
became
a
forbidden
love
story
—
the
stuff
of
a
toxic
man
's
fantasy
"
,
and
called
it
"
regressive
rather
than
transgressive
"
.
He
received
negative
reviews
for
his
acting
,
with
critic
Robert
Daniels
of
The
Playlist
writing
,
"
Tesfaye
is
also
a
terrible
actor
.
He
lacks
the
comfortability
,
the
gravitas
,
charisma
,
and
charm
to
increase
the
viability
of
Jocelyn
being
attracted
to
him
.
In
most
scenes
,
Tesfaye
either
hides
under
the
cover
of
dim
lighting
,
obtrusive
coverage
,
or
re-recorded
dialogue
dubbed
into
several
scenes
.
"

Artistry
Influences
Tesfaye
cites
Michael
Jackson
,
Prince
,
and
R.
Kelly
as
his
main
musical
inspirations
.
He
has
attributed
Jackson
's
music
as
key
in
spurring
him
to
be
a
singer
,
referencing
the
lyrics
to
"
Dirty
Diana
"
as
an
example
.
His
high
-
flying
vocal
style
was
influenced
by
Ethiopian
singers
such
as
Aster
Aweke
.
He
grew
up
listening
to
a
variety
of
music
genres
,
including
soul
,
hip
hop
,
funk
,
indie
rock
,
and
post-punk
.
Tesfaye
is
heavily
influenced
by
1980s
music
,
and
credits
the
video
game
Grand
Theft
Auto
:
Vice
City
(
2002
)
for
"
opening
my
eyes
"
to
the
music
of
that
era
.
"
I
've
always
had
an
admiration
for
the
era
before
I
was
born
"
,
he
said
in
an
interview
for
Billboard
.
"
You
can
hear
it
as
far
back
as
my
first
mixtape
that
the
'80s
–
Siouxsie
and
the
Banshees
,
Cocteau
Twins
–
play
such
a
huge
role
in
my
sound
.
"
Tesfaye
has
named
Deftones
as
one
of
his
influences
during
the
making
of
House
of
Balloons
,
Thursday
and
Echoes
of
Silence
.
He
has
also
cited
Lana
Del
Rey
,
David
Bowie
,
the
Smiths
,
Bad
Brains
,
Talking
Heads
,
DeBarge
,
50
Cent
,
Wu
-
Tang
Clan
,
and
Eminem
as
influences
and
inspirations
.
When
Daft
Punk
announced
their
split
in
2021
,
Tesfaye
praised
them
during
an
interview
with
Variety
,
saying
:
"
Those
guys
are
one
of
the
reasons
I
make
music
,
so
I
ca
n't
even
compare
them
to
other
people
...
"
Production
and
songwriting
Tesfaye
's
songs
are
"
built
around
a
fogged
,
crepuscular
production
"
,
and
feature
slow
tempos
,
rumbling
bass
,
and
forlorn
echoes
.
His
music
incorporates
samples
that
are
unconventional
in
R&B
production
,
including
punk
,
shoegaze
,
dream
pop
and
alternative
rock
.
Marc
Hogan
of
Spin
says
that
Tesfaye
's
samples
tend
"
to
draw
from
rock
critic
-
approved
sources
,
though
generally
ones
that
already
share
elements
of
his
sexual
menace
"
,
sampling
artists
such
as
Beach
House
,
Siouxsie
and
the
Banshees
and
Aaliyah
.
Tesfaye
worked
mostly
with
producers
Illangelo
and
Doc
McKinney
,
whom
Ian
Cohen
of
Pitchfork
credits
with
developing
"
a
state
-
of
-
the
-
art
R&B
template
"
with
the
artist
.
In
concert
,
Tesfaye
reappropriates
his
digitized
productions
with
a
suite
-
like
arena
rock
aesthetic
.
His
emotional
,
plaintive
lyrics
often
express
feelings
of
hurt
and
deal
with
subject
matter
such
as
sex
,
drugs
,
and
partying
;
this
is
seen
especially
in
After
Hours
and
House
of
Balloons
.
Hermione
Hoby
of
The
Guardian
characterizes
Tesfaye
's
songs
as
"
narcotised
-
slow
jams
"
and
delineates
their
message
as
"
partying
is
an
existential
experience
,
sex
is
fraught
with
alienation
,
and
everything
registers
as
unreal
and
unsettling
.
"
Paul
MacInnes
of
The
Guardian
stated
that
he
views
Tesfaye
's
three
mixtapes
as
"
a
rough
trajectory
of
party
,
after
-
party
and
hangover
.
"
Anupa
Mistry
of
the
Toronto
Standard
observes
throughout
his
mixtapes
a
"
cast
of
supine
,
stoned
zombie
-
women
...
whose
legs
willingly
part
after
being
plied
with
substances
and
who
morph
into
threats
only
when
[
he
is
]
coming
down
and
feeling
vulnerable
.
"
Tesfaye
has
stated
that
by
singing
vulgar
,
ignorant
lyrics
in
an
elegant
,
sexy
way
,
he
is
"
paying
homage
to
R
Kelly
,
and
even
Prince
to
a
certain
extent
.
"
Voice
and
music
style
Tesfaye
often
sings
in
a
falsetto
register
.
J.
D.
Considine
finds
his
singing
's
"
tremulous
quality
"
similar
to
Michael
Jackson
,
but
writes
that
he
eschews
Jackson
's
"
strong
basis
in
the
blues
"
for
a
more
Arabic
-
influenced
melisma
.
Tesfaye
possesses
a
wide
light
-
lyric
tenor
vocal
range
,
which
spans
over
three
octaves
.
His
vocal
range
reaches
its
extreme
low
at
the
bass
F
(
F2
)
,
and
its
peak
high
at
the
tenor
G
♯
(
G
♯
5
)
,
with
a
natural
tessitura
within
the
upper
fourth
octave
.
Tesfaye
often
makes
use
of
his
head
voice
to
build
resonance
to
belt
out
strong
high
notes
within
the
fifth
octave
.
Tesfaye
's
vocals
have
a
recognizable
Ethiopian
characteristic
.
Hannah
Giogis
of
Pitchfork
notes
that
"
his
trademark
vibrato
,
the
characteristically
pained
whine
that
pervades
much
of
Tesfaye
's
music
,
draws
from
a
long
Ethiopian
musical
legacy
of
tortured
pining
.
Imbuing
our
voices
with
the
shaky
pain
of
loss
—
romantic
or
otherwise
—
is
a
hallmark
of
Ethiopian
musical
tradition
.
Tesfaye
,
with
his
staccato
wails
and
aching
nostalgia
,
is
a
young
,
North
American
addition
to
a
dynasty
of
melodramatic
Ethiopian
singers
.
"
In
2023
,
Rolling
Stone
ranked
the
Weeknd
at
number
110
on
its
list
of
the
200
Greatest
Singers
of
All
Time
.
Tesfaye
's
discography
spans
pop
,
R&B
,
hip
hop
,
dance
,
alternative
and
new
wave
genres
.
His
work
is
generally
categorized
as
alternative
R&B
,
due
to
his
contributions
in
broadening
the
genre
's
musical
palette
to
incorporate
indie
and
electronic
styles
.
Mistry
writes
that
he
"
will
be
obsequiously
praised
as
the
future
of
R&B
music
—
because
Tesfaye
is
a
black
singer
,
not
because
he
's
making
quantifiable
,
canonical
R&B
.
"
Tesfaye
shared
his
thoughts
on
the
primary
label
during
an
interview
with
Time
in
2015
,
stating
:
"
Alternative
R&B
is
in
my
soul
.
It
's
not
going
anywhere
.
When
I
put
out
songs
from
House
of
Balloons
in
2010
,
people
said
I
made
R&B
cool
again
.
I
'm
assuming
that
's
when
the
label
was
created
.
I
feel
honored
that
a
good
part
of
today
's
music
is
inspired
by
it
,
consciously
or
subconsciously
.
The
only
way
I
could
have
done
that
was
to
be
ambitious
and
grand
.
"
Tesfaye
's
first
three
mixtapes
;
House
of
Balloons
,
Thursday
and
Echoes
of
Silence
,
are
alternative
R&B
projects
that
draw
on
dream
pop
,
post-punk
and
trip
hop
,
amongst
others
.
His
debut
studio
album
Kiss
Land
is
categorized
as
R&B
and
dark
wave
.
His
next
three
albums
,
Beauty
Behind
the
Madness
,
Starboy
and
After
Hours
,
are
considered
R&B
and
pop
;
with
Starboy
utilizing
heavy
trap
influences
,
and
After
Hours
drawing
on
new
wave
and
dream
pop
influences
.
Tesfaye

Controversies
Plagiarism
allegations
In
December
2015
,
Tesfaye
was
sued
by
Cutting
Edge
Music
,
which
alleged
that
the
bassline
for
"
The
Hills
"
had
been
taken
from
a
composition
featured
in
the
score
for
the
2013
science
fiction
film
The
Machine
.
One
of
the
producers
of
the
song
was
alleged
to
have
sent
a
private
Twitter
message
to
Tom
Raybould
,
the
composer
of
the
film
's
score
,
to
tell
him
about
the
sample
.
In
September
2018
,
Tesfaye
and
Daft
Punk
were
sued
for
allegedly
stealing
the
rhythm
for
"
Starboy
"
from
Ethiopian
poet
and
singer
-
songwriter
Yasminah
.
Tesfaye
denied
the
allegations
.
In
April
2019
,
Tesfaye
was
sued
by
British
trio
William
Smith
,
Brian
Clover
,
and
Scott
McCulloch
,
who
accused
Tesfaye
of
copyright
infringement
from
plagiarising
their
song
"
I
Need
to
Love
"
in
order
to
create
his
song
"
A
Lonely
Night
"
.
They
sought
$
150,000
from
Tesfaye
and
Belly
.
In
August
2019
,
the
lawsuit
was
dismissed
via
summary
judgment
with
the
option
to
amend
,
with
the
court
ruling
that
they
had
failed
to
show
that
Tesfaye
or
anyone
else
involved
in
making
"
A
Lonely
Night
"
had
access
to
their
song
or
that
the
works
were

verse

You
said
you
might
be
into

said
you

Keeping
your
heart
safe

Well

baby
,
you
can
bring
a
friend

She
can
ride
on
top
your
face

While
I
fuck
you
straight
"
,
were
accused
of
being
homophobic

fetishizing
bisexuality

falsehood
that
a
person
who
identifies
as
being
part

LGBTQ
+
community
can
be
"
turned
straight
"

addressed

controversy

song

Snowchild
"
from

Hours
,
with
the
lines
"
Every
month
another
accusation

Only

The
Idol
allegations
On
March
1
,
2023
,
Rolling
Stone
released
a
lengthy
exposé
on
the
working
conditions
and
set
life
of
the
HBO
drama
series
The
Idol
,
a
series
in
which
Tesfaye
stars
,
co-created
and
co-wrote
alongside
Sam
Levinson
.
The
series
received
significant
controversy
for
its
graphic
depiction
of
sexual
content
which
critics
labeled
"
torture
porn
"
.
The
series
was
originally
directed
by
Amy
Seimetz
who
suddenly
"
exited
with
roughly
80
percent
of
the
six
-
episode
series
finished
"
.
The
series
saw
a
major
creative
overhaul
,
as
it
was
reported
that
Tesfaye
felt
the
show
had
too
much
of
a
"
female
perspective
"
.
Over
14
crew
members
alleged
a
toxic
work
environment
with
one
adding
"
What
I
signed
up
for
was
a
dark
satire
of
fame
and
the
fame
model
in
the
21st
century
...
"
however
,
"
It
went
from
satire
to
the
thing
it
was
satirizing
.
"
Sources
alleged
that
Seimetz
's
approach
to
the
story
was
scrapped
and
the
show
became
"
like
any
rape
fantasy
that
any
toxic
man
would
have
in
the
show
—
and
then
the
woman
comes
back
for
more
because
it
makes
her
music
better
"
.
In
response
to
the
allegations
,
Tesfaye
mocked
the
reporting
on
his
Twitter
account
,
posting
a
clip
of
the
characters
in
the
show
discussing
the
magazine
saying
,
"
Rolling
Stone
?
Are
n't
they
a
little
irrelevant
?
"
.
Tesfaye
posted
the
comment
in
the
caption
:
"
@Rolling
Stone
did
we
upset
you
?
"
.
Tesfaye
's
response
received
widespread
criticism
.
In
an
interview
with
Vanity
Fair
,
he
continued
to
dismiss
the
reporting
,
saying
that
logistical
difficulties
with
Seimetz
's
schedule
and
production
timelines
,
as
well
as
a
desire
not
to
rush
his
first
show
,
propelled
the
overhaul
.

Personal

life
out
of
the
public
eye
.
In
the
beginning
of
his
career
,
he
refrained
from
participating
in
interviews
and
instead
chose
to
communicate
via
Twitter
,
which
he
attributed
to
shyness
and
insecurities
.
He
prefers
to
be
interviewed
only
in
rare
situations
.
Tesfaye
was
raised
as
an
Ethiopian
Orthodox
.
When

or
not
he
was
still
religious
,
he
stated
to
Variety
in

,
"
I
du
n
no
...
everything
is
a
test
,
and
if
you
are
religious
or
spiritual
,
you
have
to
go
through
things
.
"
From
April
2015
to
August
2019
,
Tesfaye
was
in
an
on
-
again
,
off
-
again
relationship
with
American
model
Bella
Hadid

starred
in
the
music
video
for

dated
American
singer
-
actress
Selena
Gomez
from

attention
,

were
the
topic
of
tabloid
speculation
.
Tesfaye
has
been
in
a
relationship
with
Saudi
-
born
disc
jockey
Simi
Khadra
since

have
noted
that
unlike
his
previous
romances
,
he
has
kept
his
relationship

private

.
Tesfaye
's
hairstyle
,
which
has
been
described
as
one
of
his
most
recognizable
traits
,
has
been
claimed
to
be
partly
inspired
by
American
artist
Jean
-
Michel
Basquiat
.
He
began
growing
it
out
in
2011
and
remarked

shampoo
every

hair

suffixed
his
first
name
with
"
xo
"
,
which
is
often
used
as
an
emoticon
for
hugs
and
kisses
.
According
to
The
Guardian
's
Hermione
Hoby
,
this
was
his
intention
,
though
others
believe
it
was
a
reference
to
his
recreational
use
of
ecstasy
and
oxycodone
.
He
later
altered
the
handles
on
his
social
media
to
reflect
his
stage
name
in
preparation
for
the
release
of
Starboy
.
In
August
2021
,
during
a
cover
story
with
GQ
,
he
described
himself
as
being
"
sober
lite
"
,
meaning
that
he
has
stopped
using
drugs
with
the
exception
of
marijuana
.
He
also
noted
that
he
drinks
alcohol
occasionally
,
stating
:
"
I
'm
not
a
heavy
drinker
,
as
much
as
I
used
to
be
.
The
romance
of
drinking
is
n't
there
.
"
In
January
2015
,
Tesfaye
was
arrested
for
allegedly
punching
a

complete
fifty
hours
of
community
service
